GD team proudly announces that the 2.2.0 version of GD Graphics
Library has been released.  We have fixed a good number of reported
bugs.  The cmake build is getting better, but most people should
still use the configure script.  See the Changelog files for a full
list with details or CVEs.

This is a recommended update.

You can download the 2.2.0 version of GD Graphics Library from
the `libgd project`_.
